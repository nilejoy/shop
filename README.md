## This project was created without having stored programs in mind!

- A stored programs dedicated project can be found on my repositories page titled **record-label**;
- This SQL code manages the data in a MySQL database highlighting its creator's skills in using primarily the DDL and DML sides of SQL;
- The tuples musn't be taken more seriously than they were meant to be, being nothing more than placeholders for entries;
- These entries allude in no shape or form to any real-life counterparts.
