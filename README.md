## This project was created without having stored programs in mind!

- A stored programs dedicated project can be found on my repositories page titled [record-label](https://github.com/nilejoy/record_label);
- This SQL code manages the data in a MySQL database highlighting its creator's skills in using DDL and DML;
- The tuples musn't be taken more seriously than they were meant to be, being nothing more than placeholders;
- These entries allude in no shape or form to any real-life counterparts.
